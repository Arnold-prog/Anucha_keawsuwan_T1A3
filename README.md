# Ruby Command Line Assignment

## Scope

The scope in a café is quite simple. When I worked in a restaurant, these were the main things that customers needed most.
 
One, was the menu, by having a menu allows the customer to see the options available and go from there. Two was having easy instructions for the customer to order. Three, give the options to add more items if they wanted to. Four, allow them to cancel the order. Five, allow seeing what they have ordered and the current total. Six confirmation if they wanted to go through with the order.
 
Then I went to think about what I should do for the staff members. When I was working the main things, I would have enjoyed options to add items, remove items and change items from the menu.

## Purpose

The purpose was in this application was to fill out all the needs stated in the scope and provide customers with an easy to follow café application allowing them to order items from the café without even needing to talk to the staff directly.
 
The issues that are trying to be resolved is, to allow the café to operate without high amounts of staff. For example, the way they use the vending machine to take orders in Japan. This was a high inspiration as when visiting there. I fell in love with the ease of ordering, you would just select what you wanted, pay for it there and hand the ticket to the staff member and your order would be brought to your table. I chose to develop something similar but in an app form.
 
The target audience is customers, who do not want to talk to people (introverted people). Customers that may not know how to order, so there are instructions for them to follow.
 
## Features

The features that I have done are:

1.  	Welcome greeting
2.      Ordering food
3.      Add multiple items/ Quantity
4.      Show final order and cost
5.      Staff mode
6.      Add Item to menu
7.      Change item on the menu
8.      Remove item to the menu
9.      Exit
10.     Thanks for coming


These are the features that I added. When the application is running there is a welcome message, with the menu displayed. The customers can choose whether they would like to order or cancel the order. Once proceeding with the order, the customers can select what they want, then the quantity they want. After adding the quantity, there will be an option of if they want to add more items, cancel the order or they have finished with the order. Now when the selection is done the total bill is shown with the items and displays thank you for coming.
 
The staff mode used will be hidden and the staff member just needs to type stuff at the beginning. The message will be displayed and you are now in staff mode. In staff mode, the member will be able to choose whether to add, remove or change items. After this is complete the staff member can exit the staff mode and see the changes they have made.

## Scope

The scope in a caf√© is quite simple. When I worked in a restaurant, these were the main things that customers needed most.
 
One, was the menu, by having a menu allows the customer to see the options available and go from there. Two was having easy instructions for the customer to order. Three, give the options to add more items if they wanted to. Four, allow them to cancel the order. Five, allow seeing what they have ordered and the current total. Six confirmation if they wanted to go through with the order.
 
Then I went to think about what I should do for the staff members. When I was working the main things, I would have enjoyed options to add items, remove items and change items from the menu.
